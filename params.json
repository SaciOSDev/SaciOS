{"google":"","body":"### Welcome to Sacramento iOS.\r\nThis page has been designed to get you started with git and github. The first thing you should do is ```fork``` this repository from the link above. This help assumes you already have git installed. If you do not have git installed [follow these instructions](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/).\r\n\r\n#### Forks\r\n\r\n1. Click on [fork repository](https://github.com/yuric/SaciOS).\r\n2. Once you are _at the project's repository page_ click on the ```fork``` link at the top.\r\n![fork bootcamp](http://help.github.com/images/bootcamp/bootcamp_3_fork.jpg)\r\n3. Now you need to clone the repository. From the Console (assuming you already installed git) copy and paste the code bellow.\r\n\r\n4. ```$ git clone git@github.com:yuric/SaciOS.git```\r\nThis will download a copy of SaciOS files to your machine. Now work on it locally and make some awesome changes. [More details on forking a repository here](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)\r\n\r\n#### Saving your work\r\n\r\n1. Saving your changes:\r\n\r\n2. ```$ git add -A``` to add all files you changed to commit queue\r\n3. ```$ git commit -m \"message explaining what you changed\"``` This is the actual commit\r\n4. ```$ git push origin``` (or if you are using a remote other than ```origin``` replace accordingly) This will push it to your github branch.\r\n\r\nMake more changes and repeat steps above until you are satisfied with what you have and are ready to merge back to Master. __Master is the result of our collective work.__ It is the base branch of code that everyone bases their files from and the branch that we will maintain for release to the app store. This branch should have no bugs (sure, right?) and before your changes are accepted your code will be reviewed.\r\n\r\n#### Pull Requests\r\n7. Send a pull request.\r\n8. TODO: I will go over pull requests next. For now you can visit http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/ to learn all about pull requests. Thanks.\r\n\r\n#### Authors and Contributors\r\nYuri Costa (@yuric)\r\n\r\nTODO: Add everyone else here as they fork and follow this project.","tagline":"Sacramento iOS Meetup Source Page","note":"Don't delete this file!
